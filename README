This repository contains several projects taken from Udacity's Self Driving Cars Nanodegree program.

Self-driving cars are set to change the way we live with technology. In this program I'm learning the skills and techniques used by self-driving car teams at the most innovative companies in the world including robotics, machine learning, computer vision, and mechanical engineering.

Self-driving cars represent one of the most significant advances in modern history. Their impact will go beyond technology, beyond transportation, beyond urban planning to change our daily lives in ways we have yet to imagine.
